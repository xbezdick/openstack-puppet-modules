upgrade:
  - Glance users who wish to configure the Swift backend
    can make use of swift_store_auth_project_domain_id and
    swift_store_auth_user_domain_id to configure the required
    keystone domain settings.
fixes:
  - Previously glance swift authentication would work only
    with keystone auth <= 2. This fix allows you to properly
    configured the (required) keystone domains for keystone
    v3 authentication.
